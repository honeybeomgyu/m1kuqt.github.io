        <p>My name? it's Cole. You don't need to know the rest. I'm mysterious and keep things to myself, sure, if we are merely acquainted. I am currently 14 years of age. I was an event of both of my parents on August 9th, in the year of 2006. My interests are, well, they change frequently. I primarily prefer listening to music. Genre? Indie pop. Vocaloid. You name it. Anything but country music. A bit of background; I took up piano for a few years, but I infrequently practice nowadays. I specify in music, german and art in my studies, averaging a higher merit — distinction. I maintain quite a charming persona, and I will be brutally honest. Feel free to contact me through the following; discord, instagram, snapchat, tiktok. I will most likely reply. I enjoy meeting new faces. If you'd like to know more, simply ask. 🤌 <br> <br>
